    <h2>Why does this exist at all?</h2>
    
    I've been always a fan of blogging about IT, networking and nerd stuff. But the last few years it was an impossible task for me. 
    Hoping that I will manage this situation in the near future I built this poor presentation page :) <p>

    Currently, I am working as a Devops/Automation Engineer developing APIs and a microservices based platform to help develop governance and automation tools.<p>
    
    I'm familiar with technologies such as Python, TICK stack, git, CI/CD, docker (swarm), ansible, cloud (Azure) among others and holding some network certifications such as Cisco CCNP R&S and CCDA
